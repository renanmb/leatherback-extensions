# Example of Extensions to run Inference in IsaacSim

The idea is to validate models for closing the Sim2Real gap.

By no mens this is a stable extension project and i

In my example must go into the isaacsim root folder (aka where the python/sh is) and run the following command and provide the patht o your standalone script.

```bash
./python.sh /home/goat/Documents/GitHub/renanmb/leatherback-extensions/leatherback.standalone.example/leatherback_standalone.py
```
